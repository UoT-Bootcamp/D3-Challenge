# Data Journalism and D3

## Background:

For a major metro paper, I am alloted the task of analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings.

The data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.

## Assignment 1: D3 Dabbler 

* For this assignment, we created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty.

* Using the D3 techniques, we created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

* Included state abbreviations in the circles.

* Added tooltip to the circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.


## Assignment 2 - Dynamic Scatter Plot

* For this, we did all the above steps.

* Further, we added three labels each on X-axis and Y-axis and user can choose it as per their choice.

* We added tooltip and included state abbreviations in the circles.
